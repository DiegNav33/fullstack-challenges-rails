## Setup

Let's set up your workstation:

1. **10:15am**: Go through a 15 min first lecture with your teacher about the tools you need to install as a developer.

2. **10:30am-1pm**: Follow [Le Wagon's setup](https://github.com/lewagon/setup) carefully and ask for help whenever you are stuck. It should take you all morning, and maybe even part of the afternoon.

3. **2pm-2:15pm**: Second 15 min lecture on command line basics (navigating through the filesystem, creating directories & files, launching your text editor from terminal, etc.)

4. **2:15pm-3pm**: Third 45 min lecture on git commands (`git add`/`git commit`/`git push`).

5. **3pm-3:15pm**: At the end of the git lecture, your teacher will show you the Kitt platform (challenges, tickets, flashcards) and how to push a solution on a demo challenge `00-Setup/00-Demo` (the teacher will solve and push this challenge with the class).

6. **3:15pm-5pm**: Time to push your attempt to the challenge `01-Submit-your-code`. This challenge is just a safety check to ensure you have correctly forked the exercise repo. No real code here, serious things begin tomorrow. Be prepared!

You now have all the tools you need to successfully work your way through the bootcamp during these 9 weeks. Remember, your new best friends on your computer are:
- **Visual Studio Code**, the text editor you will use to write Ruby code (and more!)
- The **Terminal**, also called a shell, where you'll type commands.
- **git**, the version control tool you'll use to watch your code, snapshot, and thus submit your solutions to Kitt!

Glad you are here! Let's rock it ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€!
