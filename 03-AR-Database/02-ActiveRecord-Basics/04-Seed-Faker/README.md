## Background & Objectives

Now you are familiar with migrations and models, it's time for a real-life scenario. How do you test if your database works, if you don't have any **data**? To do this, we need to create a bunch of data that we can use to bootstrap our database. It's called a `seed`.

### Seeding your database

To add some data after a database is created, you can start by filling up the file `db/seeds.rb` with some Ruby commands you would like to execute. For example, if you want to create 3 posts:

```ruby
# db/seeds.rb
Post.create(title: "My first post", url: "https://www.blog.com/my-first-post", votes: 13)
Post.create(title: "My second post", url: "https://www.blog.com/my-second-post", votes: 42)
Post.create(title: "My third post", url: "https://www.blog.com/my-third-post", votes: 128)
```

Or if you want to create 10:

```ruby
# db/seeds.rb
10.times do |i|
  Post.create(title: "My post number #{i}")
end
```

You can then execute this file by running in your terminal:

```bash
rake db:seed
```

### Faking data

When you seed data into your database, you may want it to look like real user data without the hassle of finding inspiration and writing it yourself. In this case, you can use the [faker](https://github.com/stympy/faker) gem to generate fake data. Let's install it:

```bash
gem install faker
```

You can then use it in in your `db/seeds.rb` file:

```ruby
# db/seeds.rb
require "faker"

Post.create(title: Faker::Music.band, url: Faker::Sports::Football.player, votes: 2)
```

Explore the [faker gem documentation](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker) to find proper modules to generate real-looking data.

### Resetting your database

Here is a useful command to `drop` your database, `recreate` it, `migrate` the schema and `seed` it. It'll save you a lot of time while building your seed, and you'll use it a lot in project weeks, so get used to it!

```bash
rake db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

Once you have reset your database, you can query your database in a `rake console`, for example with:

```ruby
Post.all
```

## Specs

Open the `db/seeds.rb` file and write some code to insert 100 posts, using fake data generated by the [`faker`](https://github.com/stympy/faker) gem. There are a ton of fun faker options in there, so get creative ðŸ˜Š.  Have a look at them [here](https://github.com/stympy/faker#faker)!
