## Background & Objectives

The goal of this and the following exercise is to implement each one of the `CRUD` operations and build a copycat of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com). For those who don't know, HackerNews is a _very minimal_ social news website (with a focus on computer science & technology), where users can submit links to articles and other users can choose to "upvote" those article links.

**Note**: in this exercise, similar to the last exercise, we **give** you the `DB` global variable, so no need to instantiate a new `SQLite3::Database` yourself. The difference from the last exercise is that this time the `DB` is a **global variable**, meaning it's accessible from everywhere in your code, so there is no need to pass the db as argument like we did in the last challenge. Just use `DB.execute` anywhere in your code, and it'll work (but feel free to have a look at `spec/models/post_spec.rb` to see how the `DB` variable is created).

## Tests

We also prepared a `test.rb` file for you where the `DB` global variable is created the same way as in `spec/models/post_spec.rb`. Feel free to use this file to call and test your methods as you go.

## Specs

### Part 1: Setup our model

We have given you a `post.rb` file with a `Post` class defined inside in order to handle the `posts` table, defined in the database as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `posts` (
  `id`  INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  `title` TEXT,
  `url` TEXT,
  `votes`  INTEGER
);
```

#### `#initialize`

As always, the first thing we should do when creating a model is define what attributes the model should have. So using the table definition above, add the `initialize` method inside your `Post` class and store the table columns as instance variables.

#### getters and setters

Next up is to define which attributes (if any) are **readable** and which are **writable**. For our HackerNews clone:

  - the `id` can be revealed but should not be editable
  - the `title` and `url` can be viewed and edited
  - the number of `votes` can be seen and incremented through upvoting, but should not be directly editable

### Part 2: READ

In this part of the exercise, we will focus on implementing our **R**ead (the `R` in `CRUD`) actions.

There are two scenarios in which we may want to **read** from our database:

  1. In order to _find_ one specific post
  2. Or, to get _all_ posts we have

Let's implement these scenarios with the following methods:

#### `#find`

Implement a **class** method `find(id)` on the `Post` class that takes an integer as an argument (the post id) and returns an instance of `Post`.

---

**Important:** The first line of your method should be this:

```rb
DB.results_as_hash = true
```

By default, when you query the database with a `SELECT` query, the `sqlite3` gem will give you something back like this:

```rb
[[1, "Why cats are awesome", "www.google.com", 10], ...]
```

This format is a little bit confusing, right? You'd have to remember that for each `row`, `row[0]` is the id, `row[1]` is the title, and so on. Wouldn't it be nicer if we could just ask for the id, instead of needing to remember that it's the first item in the array? Well, we can by having`sqlite3` give us back a `Hash` by saying `DB.results_as_hash = true`. Then, we'd get something back like:

```rb
[{ "id" => 1, "title" => Why cats are awesome", "url" => "www.google.com", "votes" => 10}, ...]
```

So, for each `row`, we could access `row["id"]` or `row["title"]` and don't have to think about confusing `Array` structures anymore üí™

---

Let's use **pseudocode** to help us in breaking down the steps we'll need:

```ruby
# TODO: Write the SQL query to get the post with the given id
# TODO: Use DB.execute to execute the SQL query
# TODO: Return the post found - as an instance of a Post!
```

‚òùÔ∏è Make sure to use the global variable `DB` defined in the program, no need for you to instantiate it yourself!

üí° HINT: make sure to pay attention to what **data type** you get back from the `DB.execute` method versus what data type **you need** to have inside your model. How can we make sure we end up with a `Post` instance?

##### SQL injections

As we learned in the lecture, we also need to protect our `find` method against **SQL injections**. As a reminder, an SQL injection is a serious security issue, where an attacker can interfere with your application by means of malicious queries to the database. Potential effects are, for example, allowing an ill-intended user to access restricted data, i.e. social security numbers, credit cards, or passwords üò±. In some cases, the attacker can even change or delete data, permanently damaging the application. If you want to read more about SQL injections and see some examples, check out the _Additional Resources_ section at the bottom of this challenge.

To protect your database against SQL injections, you must never interpolate SQL queries with user data but use `?` [**placeholders**](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/sql/#placeholders-sqlite-gem) instead.

‚ÑπÔ∏è For this exercise, to prevent SQL injections you'll need to pass _several arguments_ to the `.execute` method. Remember to check out the lecture slides for a refresher on how this is done.

#### `#all`

Next, implement a **class** method `all` on the `Post` class which takes no argument and will return an array containing every `Post` instance our database has.

**Important:** The first line of your method should be this, like we did with `#find`:

```rb
DB.results_as_hash = true
```

Again, let's use **pseudocode** to help us break down our steps:

```ruby
# TODO: Write the SQL query to get all posts from the database
# TODO: Use DB.execute to execute the SQL query
# TODO: Return an array of all posts - all as Post instances!
```

Just as in the `#find` method, we need to pay attention to what **data types** we get back from the `DB.execute` method versus what data types **we need** to have inside our model!

**Optional: Refactoring**

You may notice that we end up repeating ourselves in the `#find` and `#all` methods when we need to convert our response data from the database into instances of `Post`. If you want, try refactoring this bit of code into a private method called `build_record(row)`, which takes a row of data from the database and converts it to a `Post` instance. Then use this `#build_record` method wherever you need to convert your data.


## Additional resources

An SQL injection is a type of attack where the person using your application won't just pass a regular integer `id` to the `find` method, but will add an evil string to damage your data. If you look at the SQL query in the spec, you'll see what we mean.
