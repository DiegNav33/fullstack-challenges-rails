## Introduction

Good object-oriented design relies on understanding how much of an object to **expose**.

Exposing an object means making its properties (internal data) available to the "public", i.e. other objects in the program or even other programs. Together, these public methods make up an object's **public interface**. The methods which are private (accessible only within the object itself) make up its **private interface**.

As a general rule, you should only expose as much of an object as is needed for other objects to interact with it. **Don't design permeable objects if they don't need to be permeable**

## Objectives

- Create a class with a public interface
- Play with getters
- Write your own `to_s` method
- Use default arguments for methods
- Learn more about custom Exceptions

Let's play with a `BankAccount` class that stores information about a bank account, and enables a user to make transactions.

## Specs

### The `BankAccount` contract in `bank_account.rb`

The public interface of the class, i.e. the set of all its public methods, is called the class contract (see the notion of [DbC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract)). It is a sort of promise made by the class to other objects or other Ruby programs. Below we specify our `BankAccount` class contract. We want to be able to do the following with our BankAccount objects **from the outside world**:
- Access owner's full name and balance
- Access only **partial** IBAN, e.g. IBAN: FR14**************606
- Print partial account info in an user-friendly way
- Withdraw or deposit money
- Print transaction history if a password is provided

### The `to_s` method

This method literally stands for "to string", and is used to give information to a user about an object. With a custom `to_s` method, you can define any behavior that you want, and you'll come across this a lot in Ruby.

We can use this method for our bank account. Once implemented, it will look like this:

```ruby
account = BankAccount.new("John Lennon", "FR14-2004-1010-0505-0001-3M02-606", 200, "yoko")

puts account
# the puts will call the `to_s` method on the object
# =>  Owner: John Lennon - IBAN: FR14**************606 - Balance: 200 euros
```

Implement your `#to_s` method, which also needs to call your partial IBAN method.

### Withdraw and Deposit

Implement `#withdraw` and `#deposit`. Both of these methods should call the private `#add_transaction(amount)` method (which is also called in the `#initialize`). Each method should return a message like "You've just withdrawn/deposited XXX euros". Remember that a withdraw is just a negative deposit ðŸ˜‰

_Note: The `amount` argument to `#add_transaction(amount)` should be an `Integer` (it should not be a `Transaction`)._

### Transactions history

Now you have to implement a `#transactions_history` method. This method takes a password hash as parameter (for example `{ password: 'yoko' }`), which is an optional parameter, and is set to an empty hash if not provided (this is the meaning of the notation `args = {}`). Your transaction history method should:

1. return a string displaying the transactions if the right password is given.
2. return `"wrong password"` if the password does not correspond to the account's password.
3. return `"no password given"` if the method is called without arguments.

## (Optional) Add a `Transaction` class

What about enhancing our bank account, by adding info about the date of each transaction? And change our transaction history method so that it prints transactions like:

```bash
+ 200 euros on 22/10/13 at 8:30am
- 120 euros on 30/11/13 at 2:30pm
+ 1050 euros on 30/11/13 at 2:30pm
```

Read about the [single responsibility principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), now ask yourself:
- What is the responsibility of the `BankAccount` class? Its main responsibility is to print basic account info and enable for cash withdrawal and deposit, right?
- Is it the responsibility of the bank account to keep track of the date of each transaction or to print each transaction nicely?

Here comes the time where you might delegate these responsibilities to another `Transaction` class which would be responsible for:
- Keeping track of the date of the deposit or withdrawal, and the amount
- Printing this info in a user-friendly fashion
- You could even think of additional data for this class such as a `@message` instance variable to store the reference string for each withdrawal/deposit ("car rental", "ibiza weekend", "christmas shopping", etc.)

After implementing your `Transaction` class, you will have to change your `BankAccount` class so that its transactions arrays store `Transaction` objects instead of numbers. You will also have to load the `transaction.rb` file in `bank_account.rb` with

```ruby
require_relative "transaction"
```

## Key learning points

- What is the public interface of a class?
- What is the difference between a getter and a setter?
- What is the `to_s` method used for?
- What are default arguments? How do you use them?
- In `bank_account.rb` what is happening in lines 2-3 and line 19?

## Further suggestions & resources

- You could use `Time#strftime` method to format your date in `Transaction#to_s`.
- Ruby has many built-in exceptions, but `DepositError` isn't one! We created our own custom exception here to provide a better described error message, which will help us debugging in the future. See [this article](https://launchschool.medium.com/getting-started-with-ruby-exceptions-d6318975b8d1), in particular the `Raising Custom Exceptions` paragraph for more details about it.
