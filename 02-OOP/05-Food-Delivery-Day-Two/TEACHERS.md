No lecture for this block.

The goal is to take the code from last block's livecode, [lewagon/food-delivery@livecode-day-one](https://github.com/lewagon/food-delivery/tree/livecode-day-one) and implement the "Sign in" feature.

- First you'll need to implement the `Employee` and the `EmployeeRepository` model
- Then add a `SessionsController` to implement the `sign_in`
- Update the router to display a different menu based on the signed in guy.

In the end, you should arrive at something like that [lewagon/food-delivery@lecture-day-two](https://github.com/lewagon/food-delivery/tree/lecture-day-two).
