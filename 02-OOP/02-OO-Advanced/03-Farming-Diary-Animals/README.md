## Background and Objectives

This challenge is an extension of the previous one: the farm welcomes its first animals!

## Specs

![Animals](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/master/ruby/farming-diary/animals.svg?sanitize=true)

Discuss with your buddy: how many classes do you think you need, and how would you structure them?

Don't `rake`! Wait until the very end of the challenge, follow the guidelines and let the farming diary guide you into coding the classes!

### Parent and children

We are now familiar with the benefits of inheritance, let's go ahead and:
- Create the three empty classes
- Set the proper inheritance relationship between the children and the parent classes

Unlike in the previous challenge, let's start by coding the common behaviour in the parent class:
- An animal is initialized with zero **energy**
- You can **feed** an animal: it will increase its **energy** by 1

### Animals Talk

To figure out the classes, let's start by the **program** we want to run:
- Open the `lib/farming_diary.rb`, read _Day Three_ and gather information to code the classes.
- Run the file with `ruby lib/farming_diary.rb`. Solve one error at a time by coding the missing `talk` method in `Cow` and `Chicken`.

Expected output:

```bash
üìù Day Three: Animals Talk
The cow says moo
The female chicken says cluck cluck
The male chicken says cock-a-doodle-doo
```

### Feed The Animals

Let's move on to the Day Four and feed all the animals at once with an iteration. Remember your animals have a shared `feed!` method? You can call the same method on two objects of different types! This concept is called [polymorphism](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/back-to-basics-polymorphism-and-ruby) ü§ì

Here is what you need to know about `feed!`:
- `Cow`: beyond gaining energy, cows produce 2 liters of **@milk**
- `Chicken`: beyond gaining energy, females produce 2 **@eggs** (and males none ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

**Hint**: the children method **extend** the parent one. Don't forget to use `super` to call the parent's part!

Expected output:

```bash
üìù Day Four: Feed The Animals
The cow produced 2 liters of milk
The female chicken produced 2 eggs
The male chicken produced 0 eggs
```

## Take away

Congratulations! You can run the `rake` now to check that your code is properly organized.

In children class, there are 4 kinds of methods:
- methods that **inherit** from the parent class: the method is only defined in the parent class
- methods that **extend** the parent's method definition: the method is slightly different in the children classes
- methods that **override** the parent's method: definition is completely different than in the parent class
- methods that are specific to the child class: they are not defined in the parent class _at all_

Extending a method requires the `super` keyword: it acts as if you copied the body from the parent method and pasted it where `super` is invoked.
