## Homepage

The landing page is the first page your user will see. Spend time making this look really nice! Imagine a brand new user coming to your site for the first time -- they should be able to easily figure out what the general idea of your app is about just by reading the landing page. Make sure to include clear, descriptive images and text here.

## Well-formatted HTML

Having well structured and **properly indented** HTML code is necessary for 2 main reasons:

1. Debugging: when your HTML code is acting funny (an element wasn't closed at all or was closed in the wrong place), it can be nearly impossible to figure out where the problem is coming from if your indentation is all over the place. Save yourself (and the TAs ðŸ˜‰) hours of pain by taking 10-15 minutes to go through your views and properly format each line of your HTML.
This goes for embedded ruby as well - make sure it's indented correctly along with the rest of your HTML code.
When you look at your HTML structure, it should look like a very satisfying [V formation of ducks](https://banner2.cleanpng.com/20180719/kjo/kisspng-duck-bird-flight-goose-flock-ducks-5b50e654b71ed8.2895934015320285007501.jpg).

2. Teamwork: if you're having a hard time understanding your HTML structure, then it's very likely the rest of your team will too. Make your and your team's life easier by creating code that anyone can come into and understand. This concept isn't limited to your bootcamp experience, but will extend into your professional career as a developer (if that's the path you go after Le Wagon).
