## Daily Standup

Let's revise how and why the daily standups should occur:

Standup meetings are held a the beginning of each day with a TA. The whole team and assigned TA should take part. Notes of the meeting should be recorded clearly in the project Slack channel. Make sure to invite your assigned TA to your project Slack channel if you haven't done so.

The aim is to keep everybody on the same page with the decisions and progress of the project, and get general guidance on your product.

Before the standup:
- Update the Kanban board if needed
- Get the latest version of your master to discuss the current state of your app
- Then, when ready, please ping or add the TA to your slack call so you can start the Standup meeting.

During the standup:
- The Project Lead should share his/her screen with the Kanban board & App opened
- Previous day's recap: round table with everyone's actual completed tasks
- Today's program: round table for which features/page you will work on today
- Address every technical concern or difficulties
- Share your general state of mind, concerns or ideas. Communication is key!
- Discuss all together with the TA every change to user stories (+ / -)

The Kanban board should support your standup meeting discussions and be updated accordingly.
