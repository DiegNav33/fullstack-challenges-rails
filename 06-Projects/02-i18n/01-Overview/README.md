## Domain Name

**First things first**: if your team didn't get around to buying & setting up a domain name on the kickoff session, please select one of your team members to do that now.

We recommend using [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com) to buy the domain, and then follow [this guide](https://www.lewagon.com/blog/buying-a-domain-on-namecheap-and-pointing-it-to-heroku) to properly connect the domain to your heroku account.

The DNS propagation can (sometimes) take up to 24 hours. So if your domain doesn't connect right away, leave it and check back on it later. If you're still having connection issues at that point, please put in a ticket with a TA to troubleshoot it.

After you've done that, please go on your batch's [Products page](https://kitt.lewagon.com/camps/<user.batch_slug>/products), select your product and click on `view details`. Please then add your domain where it asks for it. This will allow the teaching crew to have an overview of your project.

Please note that Le Wagon is an official partner of GitHub since 2015. Hence, our partnership allows you to redeem an access to the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). You can find all the info in the [here](https://www.notion.so/lewagon/GitHub-Student-Developer-Pack-cc73194095034af1a0db32628b729bc3).
