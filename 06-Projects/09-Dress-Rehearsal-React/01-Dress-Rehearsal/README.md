Time to get the final feedbacks and add the finishing touches to your app!

After the break, we will begin rehearsing your final pitches. This time, each group will have a 1:1 session with the teaching staff, while the rest of the class continues working on their apps.

It will be the same rules as for previous demos (3-5 minutes, start from the pain, embody a use case, etc)

The jury will then give its final feedback on:
- quick wins in the features / UX / design
- the pitch itself: the story, the features to showcase, the pitching skills (attitude, tone, voice level, verbal tics, etc)

You then have the rest of the day to implement the feedbacks in your code and merge / deploy / prepare your production's environment for the final demo.

Let's rock this! ðŸ’ª
