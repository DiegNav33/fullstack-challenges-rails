Nearly there - keep pushing!

It's time to do some technical setups to check that everything is working correctly.

## Checklist

Please note: To release the checklist panel in your [product's page](https://kitt.lewagon.com/camps/<user.batch_slug>/products), enter your domain name in your Tech Specs panel.

At this point, your product should be shaping up! But we want to make sure it's all set up so that it looks really legit when you share it around to all your family, friends & future employers üòÅ

So, it's time to perform some sanity checks:
- [Your app is up](https://github.com/lewagon/product/blob/master/checklist/01_your_app_is_up.md)
- [Naked domain is redirected to www](https://github.com/lewagon/product/blob/master/checklist/02_naked_domain_is_redirected_to_www.md)
- [Title tag is set](https://github.com/lewagon/product/blob/master/checklist/03_title_tag_is_set.md)

- [og:image has the right dimensions](https://github.com/lewagon/product/blob/master/checklist/07_og_image_has_the_right_dimensions.md)
