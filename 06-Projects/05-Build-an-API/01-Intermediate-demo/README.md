Your intermediate demo is approaching! This is an exciting time, as it's the only moment before Demo Day that you'll see what all the other teams have been working on. After this Demo, the pitch practices will happen 1:1 with your team and some selected teachers/TAs. So it's time to show off all the hard work you've put in until now!

By now you should know the drill:
- **After the break: Stop coding any new features**
- Push your branches
- Solve conflicts
- Improve your seeds
- Debug
- Merge branches
- Push to Heroku
- Debug again ðŸ˜…
- Prepare your pitch
- Demo time!

## Demos

What makes a good demo?
- 3-5 minutes per product
- 1-2 speakers, 1 assistant (if non-remote)
- No demos on `localhost`, demos must take place on production environments
- Embody a use case, starting from your pain - do not describe the features you coded.
- Have realistic data on your website (this means working on your seeds ðŸ˜‰)
- Practice, practice, practice!

Get some inspiration on how to prepare your own demo by familiarising yourself with previous projects. This is a super useful way to understand what makes a good user journey and pitch. There are many, many, many available to watch online.

During the demos, make sure that the team members who aren't presenting take notes on the feedbacks that the teaching team will be giving afterward. You'll need to have this in order to implement the feedbacks next week!
