It's finally the day we've all been waiting for!

Today there should be **no coding** -- unless there's a last minute fire to put out of course ðŸ˜‰

Instead, today should only be about the following:
- Rehearse
- Rehearse again
- Rehearse 1-10 more times
- Relax and enjoy your final day of this wild ride

Congratulations on making it to the end! You and your team have built something amazing and you should be very proud. Good luck and have fun! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
