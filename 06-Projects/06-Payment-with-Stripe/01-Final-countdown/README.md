It's the second half of projects ðŸ˜± and the final stretch of the bootcamp! Let's figure out a game plan to make the best use of the remaining time.

## Demo Feedbacks

At the end of the last session, you demoed your products and got feedback on ways to improve from the teaching team. In today's standup, you have three things to focus on:
- Implementing the feedback from the demo
- Improving your existing features, if needed
- Choosing which, if any, additional features to add to your product

Remember that at this point, your core user journey should essentially be complete. If it's not, finishing that should be your priority. If it is complete, or pretty much complete, you can discuss amongst your team what features to prioritize with the remaining time.

## Timeline

Quick note on the schedule: There will be no coding done on Demo Day. The session before Demo Day will be the Dress Rehearsal, and your app needs to be basically completed at that point. Additionally, the presenter(s) will need to spend time perfecting the user journey and pitch prior to the Dress Rehearsal. That means there isn't actually that much time left overall... so make sure to use it wisely!
