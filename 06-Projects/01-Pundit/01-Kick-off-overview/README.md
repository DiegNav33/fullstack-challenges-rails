You now belong to a team with a clear concept for the MVP you are going to be building for the rest of the bootcamp. The goal of the kick off is the same as Airbnb Kick Off.

The kick off will encompass the following parts:

* Product Design ðŸ¤”
  * User Stories
  * DB Schema
  * Routes & Mockup
* Building ðŸ› 
  * Rails New
  * Models/Controllers
  * Figma
* Project Management
  * Kanban Board
  * Domain Name
  * Team Slack Channel

For **each step of Product Design**, you must put in a ticket to get it validated by a TA before proceeding.

During the **Building** phase, pair-programming is strongly recommended to generate the core models and the main controllers before dispatching the user stories to team members.

At the end of Kick-off,
- your Github repo should be created and your local work in progress pushed
- your Heroku app should be up to let you deploy continuously during the next sessions
- all your projects urls should be submitted on your product page

Happy Kick-off ðŸš€!
