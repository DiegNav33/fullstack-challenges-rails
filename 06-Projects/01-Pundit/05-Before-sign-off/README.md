## Product Page

On Kitt, we also centralize all your different links for your project. Please go on your batch's [Products page](https://kitt.lewagon.com/camps/<user.batch_slug>/products), select your product and click on `view details`. Take the time to fill out the different sections of your product page. This will allow the teaching crew to have an overview of your project.

## End of Kick-off

Before signing off, ask your teammates if there is any work done that can be merged in `master` and deployed ðŸš€

```zsh
git status # must be clean
git co master
git pull origin master
git push heroku master
```
