At last, Rails!

## First week - Rails 101

This is the last "real week" on Kitt with day-by-day challenges. From next week, you'll start working on longer projects, either an Airbnb clone or your own personal project. For now, we will dive into the architecture of a fresh Rails app and try to understand what's going on. **We'll build one Rails app per day**.

### `01 Routing, Controllers & Views`

Your first day will introduce the standard Rails flow of `routing > controller > view` without adding the model layer and explaining `params`. Over the course of the day, you'll be transforming old ruby challenges from Week 1 into Rails apps.

### `02 Models & CRUD`

Here comes our old friend Active Record again! **One of the most important Rails lectures.** Your lead coach will code all of the 7 CRUD actions from scratch and introduce the `resources` routing. Pay attention! ðŸ¤“

### `03 Advanced Routing`

Today you will add a second model to a Rails app by building a two model clone of Yelp, with restaurants and reviews. The morning lecture is about going **Beyond CRUD** with advanced routing and validations in Rails.

### `04 Rails Assets`

Learn the best setup for implementing Bootstrap SCSS + front-end libraries, and switch from `form_with` to `simple_form_for` using Simple Form Bootstrap config.

Learn about the asset pipeline.

For the exercises, you'll start a two-day build of a watch list app, with 3 modelsÂ `Movie`, `Bookmark`, andÂ `List`.
You will have to follow the front-end setup carefully to work on a nice-looking app.

### `05 Hosting & Image Upload`

This  morning lecture has 2 parts:
**Hosting**: Deployment on [Heroku](http://heroku.com/)

**Image Upload**: We'll host images on [Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com/), using [ActiveStorage](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v6.0.1/active_storage_overview.html). The course also explains how you can secure your API keys using the [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) gem. **Listen carefully if you don't want your bank details stolen on Github.**

Also, **quiz time**! Your last one! Don't be sad ðŸ˜¢

We'll take a step back and check you've grasped all the core notions of Rails.

## Second part - Airbnb

**AirBnB**! For the second part, we'll work in your project teams of 3 or 4. The goal is to start from scratch and build an MVP of AirBnB - you'll have 5 blocks to go as far as you can on your clone.

- First demo at the halfway point - If a full-time bootcamp, on Wednesday (5pm)
- **Official demo on the last day!** If a full-time bootcamp, on Friday! (5pm)

**No live-code for this week, except on the first block.** But you still have morning lecture at 9am on cool topics. So get up early! Here is an overview of what will be covered:

### `06 Devise`

2-parts morning lecture:

- Authentication with [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) gem.
- Collaboration techniques with git & Github. You will discover how to work in a dev team using `branches` and `pull requests`. It's a system you will use for every dev project you ever do, so pay attention!

### `07 JavaScript in Rails`

Learn how to use Stimulus and `importmap` to implement new JavaScript features and to use third party libraries in Rails.

### `08 Geocoding`

Morning lecture on geocoding (with the `geocoder` gem) and Mapbox to add a map to your application and autocomplete on address form inputs.

Then, every group should demo the current version of their Airbnb clone in front of the class.

### `09 Search`

Today's lecture covers the search topic, from the search 101 using Active Record to stronger solutions like ElasticSearch or Algolia.

### `10 Pundit`

Following on from Devise, we will teach you how to handle **authorization** in your Rails app and make sure only the restaurant creator can update it or destroy it!

### Projects prep (weekend)

You've done amazing things - we are really proud of you!

Now, it's time for the Grand Finale - your projects. Take a bit of time over the weekend to think about your projects:

- Write your user stories (not more than 15).
- Draw mockups of your main views on a paper.
- Start building your DB schema on [db.lewagon.com](http://db.lewagon.com).
- Start thinking about your routes.

If you can get most of this done, you'll save a lot of time on Monday and be able to start on your projects without too much fuss.
