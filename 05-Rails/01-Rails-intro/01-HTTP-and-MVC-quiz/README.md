## Background & Objectives

Before we move on to building our first Rails apps and looking at the router, controllers and views, let's revisit some topics that will be vital in your rails development.

## Specs

Look at the `lib/quiz.rb` file. You will find a quiz with a few methods
to test your HTTP and MVC basic knowledge. Make sure each of the methods returns
the correct information to pass the quiz! ⚠️ Try and answer them before running `rake`.

### Question 1

Return a `String` with what **HTTP** stands for. Remember, HTTP is the protocol that
allows a client (a browser running on a computer) to communicate with a remote server
so that it can send requests, and receive back files (html, css, js, etc.).

### Question 2

You will see two variables declared, with `String` values describing the number of HTTP
requests made when you visit any web page. One statement is false and the other is true.
Return the one that is **true**.

### Question 3

You will see three variables declared with `String` values, each describing the role of
either the Model, View, or Controller in the MVC design pattern. Return the variable whose
value describes the role of the **View**.

## Key learning points

- What HTTP stands for and what it does.
- Re-visit the MVC design pattern.
