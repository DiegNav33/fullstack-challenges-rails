## Background & Objectives

Now it's time to make a 3-model app! And you guessed it, we'll be introducing a many to many relationship (`N:N`). So what's the deal? Well, itâ€™s time to build yourself a Watch List. You'll be able to create lists in which you will save your favourite movies.

Here are the **user actions** we want to implement in our app:
- As a user, I can see all my movie lists
- As a user, I can create a movie list
- As a user, I can see the details of a movie list
- As a user, I can bookmark a movie inside a movie list
- As a user, I can destroy a bookmark

**Warning** the movies will be seeded in the database so no need to implement any user action around the `movie` model.

## Rails app generation

**Note**: You should now be able to run these steps without this cheat sheet! Don't forget the `-d postgresql` (we will talk about this during the next session). ðŸ˜‰

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>
rails new rails-watch-list -d postgresql --skip-action-mailbox -T
cd rails-watch-list
```

We then need to create the postgresql database for this new rails app.

```bash
rails db:create
```

Let's set up git, create a repo on GitHub and push our skeleton.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "rails new"
gh repo create --public --source=.
git push origin master
```

Let's import the teacher's spec to be able to `rspec` our progress. **Note: You will use the `rspec` command instead of the `rake` command to run the tests for this challenge.**

```bash
echo "gem 'rspec-rails', group: [ :test ]" >> Gemfile
echo "gem 'rails-controller-testing', group: [ :test ]" >> Gemfile
bundle install
rails db:migrate
rails db:test:prepare
git submodule add https://github.com/lewagon/fullstack-challenges-04-Rails-watch-list-specs.git spec
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare rails app with external specs"
```

You'll be able to test your code with:

```bash
rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test  # If you added a migration
rspec spec/models                # Launch tests
```

Before starting to code, don't forget to setup your Rails app for Front-end. Like in the lecture, let's add the gems we're going to need:

```ruby
# Gemfile
# [...]
gem "bootstrap", "~> 5.2"
gem "autoprefixer-rails"
gem "font-awesome-sass", "~> 6.1"
gem "simple_form"
gem "sassc-rails" # Uncomment this line
```

```bash
bundle install
rails generate simple_form:install --bootstrap
```

Then let's download the Le Wagon's stylesheets:

```bash
rm -rf app/assets/stylesheets
curl -L https://github.com/lewagon/stylesheets/archive/master.zip > stylesheets.zip
unzip stylesheets.zip -d app/assets && rm stylesheets.zip && mv app/assets/rails-stylesheets-master app/assets/stylesheets
```

Finally let's import the Boostrap JS library with `importmap`:

```bash
importmap pin bootstrap
```

In `application.js`, add the following lines:

```js
// app/javascript/application.js
import "bootstrap"
import "@popperjs/core"
```

And then in `manifest.js`, add the following lines:

```js
// app/assets/config/manifest.js
//= link popper.js
//= link bootstrap.min.js
```

And finally in `config/importmap.rb`:

```rb
# config/importmap.rb

# replace these lines:
# pin "bootstrap" # @5.3.2
# pin "@popperjs/core", to: "@popperjs--core.js" # @2.11.8

# with this:
pin "bootstrap", to: "bootstrap.min.js", preload: true
pin "@popperjs/core", to: "popper.js", preload: true
```

Don't forget to `commit` and `push` your work often.

## Specs

### 1 - Models

Go to [db.lewagon.com](http://db.lewagon.com) and draw the schema with your buddy. The tables we need areÂ `movies`,Â `lists`Â andÂ `bookmarks`. Think about the relations between the tables and who is storing the *references*. ðŸ˜‰

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/master/rails/watch-list/db.png)

Once you've finished designing the schema, it's time to implement the models inside your app. Make sure to set them up with the right attributes, validations, and associations, using the tests as a guide together with the specifications found below.

**Important**

To test your code, don't use `rake`, but rather:

```bash
rspec spec/models
```

to only run the model specific tests that can be found in the `spec/models` folder.

Ensure that all the tests pass successfully before moving on to Parts 2 and 3 of this challenge.

#### Attributes

- A **movie**Â has a **title** (e.g.Â `"Wonder Woman 1984"`), an **overview** (`"Wonder Woman comes into conflict with the Soviet Union during the Cold War in the 1980s!"`), a **poster url** and a **rating** (6.9).
- A **list**Â has a **name** (e.g.Â `"Drama"`,Â `"Comedy"`, `"Classic"`, `"To rewatch"`, ... )
- A **bookmark** adds a movie to a list (e.g. Wonder Woman has been added to the "Girl Power" watch list). So each **bookmark** references a movie and a list, with a **comment**. The **comment** field is for the user to add a little note on the bookmark (e.g. Alan Turing recommended this movie).

#### Validation

- A movie must have a unique title and an overview.
- A list must have a unique name.
- A bookmark must be linked to a movie and a list, and the [movie, list] pairings should be unique.
- The comment of a bookmark cannot be shorter than 6 characters.

#### Associations

- A list has many bookmarks
- A list has many movies through bookmarks
- A movie has many bookmarks
- A bookmark belongs to a movie
- A bookmark belongs to a list
- You canâ€™t delete a movie if it is referenced in at least one bookmark.
- When you delete a list, you should delete all associated bookmarks (but not the movies as they can be referenced in other lists).

### 2 - Seed the movies

**Our app will not allow users to create movies**.
Instead, we will generate a static seed of movies to choose from.
Write this seed, for example

```ruby
# db/seeds.rb
Movie.create(title: "Wonder Woman 1984", overview: "Wonder Woman comes into conflict with the Soviet Union during the Cold War in the 1980s", poster_url: "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/8UlWHLMpgZm9bx6QYh0NFoq67TZ.jpg", rating: 6.9)
Movie.create(title: "The Shawshank Redemption", overview: "Framed in the 1940s for double murder, upstanding banker Andy Dufresne begins a new life at the Shawshank prison", poster_url: "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/q6y0Go1tsGEsmtFryDOJo3dEmqu.jpg", rating: 8.7)
Movie.create(title: "Titanic", overview: "101-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater tells the story of her life aboard the Titanic.", poster_url: "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/9xjZS2rlVxm8SFx8kPC3aIGCOYQ.jpg", rating: 7.9)
Movie.create(title: "Ocean's Eight", overview: "Debbie Ocean, a criminal mastermind, gathers a crew of female thieves to pull off the heist of the century.", poster_url: "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/MvYpKlpFukTivnlBhizGbkAe3v.jpg", rating: 7.0)
```

### Optional:

Have fun and seed fake movies using the [faker gem](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker).

Even better, seed real movies by using [this API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-top-rated-movies) (with `open-uri` and `json` ruby libs).

**API Setup**

The endpoints of the API requires you to sign up and generate an API key. Since the process of doing that is quite long, at Le Wagon, we kindly provided you with a **proxy** to that API. Thanks to this proxy, you'll be able to use that API without generating an API key yourself. You should use this tool for this challenge only! We trust you!

Here's how it works:

1. the API would say: use `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/top_rated?api_key=<your_api_key>`
2. What you should do is replace this part of the url `https://api.themoviedb.org/3?api_key=<your_api_key>` by `https://tmdb.lewagon.com`. For example, `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/top_rated?api_key=<your_api_key>` would become `https://tmdb.lewagon.com/movie/top_rated`.
3. You can [try it here](https://tmdb.lewagon.com/movie/top_rated)

**Movie Images**

To understand how to get the movie images from the API, make sure to carefully read [this page](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/images) in the docs.

### 3 - Routing, Controller, Views for Lists

**Important**

Don't use `rspec` to code the applicative part. It's time to launch a `rails s` in your terminal and open a browser at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). Always code in silo:

- start with the **route**,
- then start coding the **controller**,
- finally start coding the **view** and refresh your browser.

When your feature is done (and looks good), move on to the next one and repeat the process!

When you think you're done with the **whole** challenge, use `rspec` to make sure it satisfies the specs.

**Features**

Once again, you must have a precise idea of the features of your app in order to build your routes. Here is the list of features:

- A user can see all the lists

```
GET "lists"
```

- A user can see the details of a given list and its name

```
GET "lists/42"
```

- A user can create a new list

```
GET "lists/new"
POST "lists"
```

### 4 - Routing, Controller, Views for bookmarks

- A user can add a new bookmark (movie/list pair) to an existing list
- CheckoutÂ `simple_form`Â [docs](https://github.com/heartcombo/simple_form#associations)Â aboutÂ `f.association`Â to easily create a select dropdown for our list of movies.

```
GET "lists/42/bookmarks/new"
POST "lists/42/bookmarks"
```

- A user can delete a bookmark from a list. How can we make a delete link again?

```
DELETE "bookmarks/25"
```

Do we need aÂ `MoviesController`?

### 5 - Design as we go

Now time to make a nice front-end! Time to play around with CSS! ðŸ˜Š Go check out [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) or [onepagelove](https://onepagelove.com/) for inspiration.

Don't forget you can have local images in the `app/assets/images` folder. Or even better, you can ask the user for an `image_url` when the user adds a new list.

### 6 - New bookmark form on the list show page (Optional)

Try to put the "New bookmark form" on the list page itself, not on a separate page, so you won't have to leave the list page to add a new movie! What changes in the routes? And in the controllers?

### 7 - List reviews (Optional)

Everyone should be able to comment and tell us what they thought of our movie collection. Let's add some reviews to our lists!
