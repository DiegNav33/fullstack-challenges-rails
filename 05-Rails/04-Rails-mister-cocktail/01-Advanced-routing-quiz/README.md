## Background & Objectives

Before we move on to the Watch List challenge, let's review some of the principles we saw yesterday when we looked at advanced routing.

## Specs

Look at the `lib/quiz.rb` file. You will find a quiz with a few methods to test your rails knowledge so far. Make sure each of the methods returns the correct information to pass the quiz!

⚠️ Try and answer them before running `rake`.

### Question 1

Implement the 7 conventional routes corresponding to the 7 CRUD routes generated by `resources :restaurants`.

Hint: a route follows this pattern: `verb "url", to: "controller#action"`.

### Question 2

Return `true` or `false` to answer this question:
If you have a one-to-many relationship between your models like `Restaurant` and `Review` (`belongs_to :restaurant`), do you always have to nest all your routes for `Review` in `Restaurant`?

### Question 3

Which Active Record validation is used to make sure that no record is created without a name? Return this as a `String`.

## Key learning points

- Understand what `resources` does in your routes.
- Understand many-to-many relationships and nested routes.
- How to add validations to our model to avoid DB inconsistencies and problems.
