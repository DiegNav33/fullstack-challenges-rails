## Background & Objectives

In this challenge, we'll retrieve data from an API and practice displaying it with HTML in DOM.

## Specs

You will build a search app to search recipes using [The MealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) and add them to your favourites.

You can use [this endpoint](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php#:~:text=Filter%20by%20main%20ingredient) to search recipes by ingredient.

Your goal is to implement in `index.js` the search logic, so we can filter by ingredient when you click on search.

Open the html page in your browser with:

```bash
serve
```

You should see a form with a search input.

- When we enter an ingredient, the page **should not reload** and we will display each recipe in the `#recipes-container` list, using some HTML.
- We should see a message indicating that there are no results in case there are no recipes using that ingredient.
- Once the search works, the second part of the challenge will be to favourite the recipes you want by clicking on the bookmark icon.
- Once bookmarked, the recipe will appear on the `#favourites-container` list.

## Search recipes

### Implement the API call

First, let's implement the API call to search recipes by ingredient.

Let's add an event listener to the `#search-input` input, and call the endpoint when the user clicks on the search button, interpolating the ingredient in the URL you are calling.

You should use fetch and `console.log(data)` to see the response from the API.

### Display the results

Now that we have the results, let's display them in the `#recipes-container` list.

Then, let's create a function `insertRecipes` that will insert the results in our list. Which parameter(s) should be passed to it?

Let's create the function with two parameters: `recipes`, `container`. The first one will be the array of recipes we get from the API, and the second one will be the container where we want to insert the recipes.

We will use the `forEach` method to iterate over the array of recipes, and for each recipe, we will generate some HTML (as a string), and insert the recipe data in the right place.

The `insertRecipes` should add the following HTML to the DOM for each recipe (of course, with the titles and images customized for each recipe):The `insertRecipes` should add the following HTML to the DOM for each recipe (of course, with the titles and images customized for each recipe):


```html
<div class="col-5">
  <div class="card my-2 position-relative">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-bookmark text-danger ms-2 position-absolute top-0 end-0 p-2 fs-4"></i>
    <img src="INSERT RECIPE IMAGE URL HERE" class="card-img-top" alt="">
    <div class="card-body d-flex">
      <h6 class="card-title">INSERT RECIPE TITLE HERE</h6>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

You should see a recipe list using the ingredient you entered in the search input:

NB: you can go to [this endpoint](https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/list.php?i=list) directly in your browser to see the full list of ingredients you can search by.

## Favourite recipes

### Add event listeners to the bookmark icons

Now that we can search recipes, let's add the functionality to bookmark them.

Let's select all the `fa-bookmark` icons and add an `eventListener` to each of them. When we will click on one, we will add the recipe to a `favourites` variable and display all of them in the `#favourites-container` list. What data type should `favourites` be?

We only see the bookmark icons on the recipe cards **after** we searched by ingredient. So we will need to add the event listeners to the bookmark icons **after** we insert the recipes in the list, in the same `fetch` method.

To do so, let's create a `addFavouriteListeners` function that will add the event listeners to the bookmark icons. It will select all the bookmark icons and for each, add an event listener to it on `click`.

### Add the recipe to the favourites list

For this, let's create a function `addRecipeToFavourites` as the `callback` function of each bookmark's event listener.

Once clicked, we need to retrieve all the elements of a recipe (its `idMeal`, `strMeal`, `strMealThumb`) before we store it in the `favourites` variable.

We will need to pass the recipe as a parameter of this function, so we can access the data we need to display it. From the `event` you can reconstruct the recipe object so we can save all its details:

```js
const newRecipeToAdd = { idMeal: ..., strMeal: ..., strMealThumb: ... };
```

We can then push this recipe object into the `favourites` variable.

Let's insert the recipe data as HTML in the right place. Wait! We already have a method that does exactly that!

`insertRecipes`, takes a recipe list and a container as parameters, and inserts the recipes in the container. Let's use it!

## Notes

Our app enables us to search for recipes by ingredient and add them to our favourites. One caveat here is that we lose our favourites every time we reload the page.

To fix this, we could use the [`localStorage` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to store our favourites in the browser. We could then retrieve them when the page loads. But don't worry, you will learn more about `localStorage` in one of the next lesson's challenges!

NB: Web-apps are often composed of two apps in reality: one of the back-end to store the data, and one front-end that will retrieve the data and display it with a framework. In this challenge, we created a front-end application that handles the user interface, while we are getting data from an API.

We will see in the next module that Rails handles both at the same time ðŸ’ª

## Bonus (optional)

- Use the `includes` method to check that a recipe is already favourited.
- Clear the search input after a search.
- Add a button to clear the favourites list.
