## Background & Objectives

Now that we have had some practice building some basic components, let's see how we can use them and combine them to make a real landing page! Any website has to have a **beautiful landing page**. It is important as it is the first page visitors will see and it needs to be good enough to convert them into clients üí∞.

In this challenge you will reproduce a classic landing page design like [this one](https://lewagon.github.io/landing-page-challenge)!

Your landing page should **at least** include:
- A **Hero / Banner** section presenting your product with a call to action.
- A **How it works** section (what components could be used to break down the different aspects of your product/service)
- A **Footer**.

## Mockup

‚ö†Ô∏è **Never start coding a page without knowing how it will look!**

In the coming weeks you will learn how to mockup your pages like a pro using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), but for today you can use a pen and paper to design the different sections of your page.

For this exercise, you should have something like this:

<div class="text-center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/master/frontend/startup-landing-drawing.png" alt="" width="100%">
</div>

‚ö†Ô∏è If you're not 100% certain you have the right structure drawn, ask a teacher to confirm before starting to code!

## Specs

Build a landing page with the following elements:
- A **Hero / Banner** section presenting your product.
- A **How it works** section.
- A **Footer**.

## Finished?

Once you've finished you can push your page to [Github pages](https://pages.github.com) once again and share it on your batch channel:

First, copy the project out of `fullstack-challenges` so we can track it as a seperate git project:

```bash
cp -r ../03-Landing-page/landing ~/code/<user.github_nickname>
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/landing
```

Then, start tracking the project with `git` and push to a `gh-pages` branch:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "my landing page"
gh repo create --public --source=.
git push origin master # push to master first
# then puts to a `gh-pages` branch
git co -b gh-pages
git push origin gh-pages
```
