## Background & Objectives

OK now that you've reproduced the designs we've given to you let's see how you manage an open component challenge 😎

You will have to find a component that you like on Dribbble and try to reproduce it.

When designing a new component you always have follow the same flow:

### Step 1: Find inspiration 🤔

Find which component you want to design (login form, tabs, navbar, etc.), here's a [Dribbble bucket](https://dribbble.com/arthur-littm/buckets/1030911-Open-Component-Challenge) we've made for this challenge. Find a shot that you like.

### Step 2: Draw the HTML structure ✏️

Now that you know what you're going to design you have to draw the structure of the HTML. The classic beginner mistake is to skip this step and dive directly in the code ⚠️. Trying to do the CSS with bad HTML structure is a nightmare 😱.

For example if you've decided to draw a component like this one, you should have the following HTML structure drawn **before any code is attempted**.

<div class="text-center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/master/frontend/open-component-challenge-structure.png" alt="">
</div>

Once you've drawn you HTML structure feel free to ask one of the TAs for their opinion about it, to be sure you're going in the right direction.

### Step 3: Code the HTML 💻

### Step 4: Code the CSS 💅

## Specs

Code the HTML in the `index.html` file.

For the CSS as usual add a new file in the `components` folder (or more if you're doing a complicated component which is using other components eg: `avatars`, `buttons`, ...).
