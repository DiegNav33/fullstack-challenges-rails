## Your CSS future is bright!

Congratulations for today, it was a very important day in your CSS career.

From now on:
- You can use the [Le Wagon UI Kit](https://uikit.lewagon.com/) without recoding simple components every time üòä
- Remember, always **take time to think about your HTML stucture** (wrapper, container, inside components, etc.). It's **90% of the work**. Once you've done that, you just need to re-use components and make some small CSS adjustments.

## (Optional) Enhanced profile on Github Pages
