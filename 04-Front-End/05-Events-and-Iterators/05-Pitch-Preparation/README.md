## Upload your pitch

**Important Reminder** - you have homework! On the next session, instead of livecode, it will be the pitch session! So you need to [upload your pitch on Kitt](https://kitt.lewagon.com/camps/<user.batch_slug>/products) before!

Remember the key points:
- Who is the **target**? Define your customer segment accurately.
- What's the **pain** your product tackles?
- What's the **solution**?

For all the information you need about what makes a good pitch, there's a small brief after tonight's livecode.

Feel free to gather questions now and ask them then ;)
