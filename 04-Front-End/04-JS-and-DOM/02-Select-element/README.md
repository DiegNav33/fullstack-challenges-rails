## Background & Objectives

In this next challenge, we are going to select an element from the DOM!

### Setup

Let's launch a local webserver by running:

```bash
serve
```

Then, open [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

## Specs

You should see the countries that won the most FIFA World Cups in an ordered list.

The goal of the challenge is to select France's `<li>` ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·!

The easiest and most straightforward way to select an element from the DOM is **with its `id`**:

- Open the `index.html` file, spot the element we want to select and set an `id` to it;
- Open the `lib/select.js` file and write the corresponding JavaScript code to select the element with the given `id`, and make the function `return` the element!

Happy selecting ðŸŽ£

**N.B:** In this challenge, the tests output is displayed directly in the browser! When you see `Congratulations!` you can `add`, `commit`, `push` and move on to the next challenge! Don't forget to pay attention to your style!
