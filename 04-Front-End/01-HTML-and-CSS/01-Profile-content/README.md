## Background & Objectives

A simple challenge to manipulate basic HTML tags and create a profile card with headers, text, lists, and images.

## Setup

Jump into your `profile` and create an `images` directory to store all your pictures:

```bash
cd profile
mkdir images
code .
```

## Local server

You can start a local webserver by typing the following command in your terminal (just make sure you are in the exercise's folder):

```bash
serve
```

(it has been defined in an [alias](https://github.com/lewagon/dotfiles/blob/f894306fd81502f1fe513dd253e3129f4b56874d/aliases#L7))

- You can now visit your files on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Modern browsers cache the **file** returned by a given **url**. It keeps in memory a version of your HTML (`http://localhost:8000`), of your CSS (`http://localhost:8000/style.css`) and even of your images (`http://localhost:8000/images/logo.png`)! Sometimes, the older version remains and your newest code is not taken into consideration. To fix this, use `Cmd + Shift + R` to **hard refresh** your page (this clears the cache in the process) üëå

## Specs

Build a simple HTML profile page with the following elements (use the right HTML tags):

- an image of yourself
- a header and sub-header with your name and your job title (you can put programmer now üíª)
- a description of yourself
- a button
- a list of your social links

A picture is worth a thousand words, [so here is what you should build in this challenge](https://lewagon.github.io/html-css-challenges/01-profile-content-new/)

## Further suggestions & resources

### Find **good** pictures

Prepare your profile image file before starting to code. For this exercise You can use your **profile picture from Facebook**, and save it in the `images` folder.

### HTML tips

- Don't forget the basic skeleton tags `<html>`, `<body>`, `<head>`.
- Don't forget the page `<title>` in the `<head>` section, and other important metatags like `<meta charset="utf-8">`.
- You can use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) to find cool icons (e.g. for social networks). It's a super useful library because all of the icons are **fonts**, making it really easy to resize them, change their color, and even add animations to them!. To import Font Awesome, simply add this link into your `<head>`:

```html
<!-- Fontawesome Stylesheet -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v6.1.2/css/all.css">
```

- You can use the `target="_blank"` attribute on your links to open them on new tabs once clicked.

## Indent or die

**Take your time to indent your HTML carefully**. HTML code has a lot of nesting - way more than Ruby. If you don't indent, it's game over for your code!

Which code is easier to understand?

This one:

```html
<ul>
    <li><a href="#">
        <i class="fab fa-facebook-f"></i> Facebook
  </a>
</li><li>
  <a href="#">
    <i class="fab fa-linkedin-in"></i> Linkedin
      </a></li>
<li>  <a href="#">
  <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i> Twitter
    </a>
  </li>
    </ul>
```

Or this one:

```html
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="#">
      <i class="fab fa-facebook-f"></i> Facebook
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">
      <i class="fab fa-linkedin-in"></i> Linkedin
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">
      <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i> Twitter
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

Indent your HTML! Your code should look like a [V formation of ducks](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Eurasian_Cranes_migrating_to_Meyghan_Salt_Lake.jpg) ü¶Üü¶Üü¶Ü!

## Finished?

Once you've finished you can push this exercise and copy the content to the next exercise folder with this command:

```bash
# Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Added content to my profile page"
git push origin master

# Copy your profile into the next exercise folder
cp -r ../profile ../../02-Fonts-and-colors
```
