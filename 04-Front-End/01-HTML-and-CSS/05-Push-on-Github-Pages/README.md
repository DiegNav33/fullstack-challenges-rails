## Setup

We don't want to keep your profile within `fullstack-challenges` because we want to version it with `git` as a separate project. So let's copy your profile as an independent folder and jump into it:

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/fullstack-challenges/04-Front-End/01-HTML-and-CSS/04-Responsive-profile
cp -r profile ~/code/<user.github_nickname>
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/profile
```

## Create the GitHub repo

You can **init**(ialize) a git repository and commit your changes:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "my profile page"
```

Then we will use the GitHub CLI (command line interface) to create the associated GitHub repo. The GitHub CLI allows you to interact with GitHub through your terminal.

### Use `gh` interactive mode

```bash
gh repo create # this launches an interactive mode to create the GitHub repo
```

You will be asked to answer few questions regarding how you wish to create your repository on GitHub:

**What would you like to do?**
Select _Push an existing local repository to GitHub_, since you've already created your local repository with `git init`.

**Path to local repository (.)**
Press `ENTER` so it selects the default option (.) which is the current folder.

**Repository name (profile)**
Press `ENTER` to select the default option (profile) which is the name of the current folder. If you want your GitHub repository to have a different name, type it in before pressing `ENTER`.

**Description**
Press `ENTER` to leave it empty for now. If you want to give your repository a description which will appear on GitHub, type it in before pressing `ENTER`.

**Visibility**
Select _Public_ and press `ENTER` so that your repository is visible by everyone.

**Add a remote? (Y/n)**
Type `Y`, then press `ENTER`. Adding a remote is going to add a link to your GitHub repository in your local git repository, so you can push your code to GitHub via git.

**What should the new remote be called? (origin)**
Press `ENTER` to keep the default option (origin) which is the standard name of the main remote.

**Would you like to push commits from the current branch to the "origin"? (Y/n)**
Type `Y`, then press `ENTER` to push your commits from your local git repository to your newly created GitHub repo.

### Use `gh` single-line command

If you wish to create a **public** repository with a single-line command instead, then you can just use the following command:

```bash
gh repo create --public --source=.
```

With gh, you can also open a GitHub repo in your browser from your terminal:

```bash
gh repo view --web
```

You can find more information about gh in [the dedicated cheatsheet](https://kitt.lewagon.com/knowledge/cheatsheets/gh_cli).

## GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a GitHub service that makes it easy to deploy any **static website** in 10 seconds (static == same content for all users). It is based on a "magic" branch, called `gh-pages`. When GitHub detects this branch, it puts your website online. Awesome right? Let's create this magic branch and push it. âœ¨ðŸŒ¿âœ¨

```bash
git co -b gh-pages
git push origin gh-pages # we push the gh-pages branch, not master!
```

Now you can visit the URL `http://<user.github_nickname>.github.io/profile/` (this is the URL built automatically by GitHub) and have a look at your masterpiece online! Share the link on Slack with your buddies.

From now and until the end of the day, you can keep working in your `~/code/<user.github_nickname>/profile` directory AND on the `gh-pages` branch. This means any updates of your profile can be pushed on `http://<user.github_nickname>.github.io/profile/` through usual git commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "make my profile prettier"
git push origin gh-pages
```

## Submit your code to Kitt

As you weren't working in the `fullstack-challenges` folder, your work hasn't been submitted on Kitt. If you want to mark this challenge as complete on Kitt you can do the following:

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/fullstack-challenges/04-Front-End/01-HTML-and-CSS/05-Push-on-Github-Pages
cp -r ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/profile .
rm -rf profile/.git
git add .
git commit -m "Submitting my work to Kitt"
git push origin master
```
