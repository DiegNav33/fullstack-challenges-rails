## Background & objectives

The goal of this challenge is to practice with more WeChat's template language.

## Specs


### 1. Setup one more page in your app

Use the setup file `app.json` to add again a new route inside the array `pages:[]`:

```
"pages/stories/stories"
```

### 2. Create a small header to begin

Let's re-use the same [Banner Component](https://uikit.lewagon.com/documentation#banners) than on our landing page, and turn it into a nice header! We can use the `inline CSS` again to customize its size... e.g 100px height.

### 3. Then a card for our stories...

We'll want a card component to display our FMC stories: each card will host **content** and **author**.

Once again we can save time using [Le Wagon's card component](https://uikit.lewagon.com/documentation#card_product) (but no need of a product image).

Just one story is enough, we're just templating here.

### 4. Data binding introduction

WXML is much more than HTML: it's a **templating language** allowing us to [inject JavaScript variables and even loop through our local data](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/en/dev/framework/view/wxml/data.html)! The magic happens when you use this syntax: `{{variable or operation}}`.

We call it the **mustache syntax** üë®‚Äçü¶∞ and it connects JS and HTML both ways...

**From JS to WXML ‚û°Ô∏è**

- Store ‚ÄòWho is here?‚Äô inside a `text` variable in the `stories.js` page data


```js
//stories.js
Page({
  data: {
    text: 'Who is here?'
  }
})
```

- Display the text inside your `stories.wxml` page


```html
<!‚Äî stories.wxml -->
<view>{{text}}</view>
```

Any string stored inside `text` will dynamically show in your view ü§ì

**From WXML to JS ‚¨ÖÔ∏è**

- Create a button with the "bindtap" attribute and a function name as a value
 
```html
<!‚Äî stories.wxml -->
<button bindtap="clickMe">{{text}}</button>
```

- Define this new function in your Page object:

```js
//stories.js
Page({
  clickMe: function() {
    this.setData({ text: "Hello World" })
  }
})
```

Well done! Now you have a button firing a a "bindtap" event to the logical layer (the JavaScript file), and a function that re-sets the local data to another string... immediately rendered in the view.

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not break the Page object! **Each key-value pair is chained with a comma.** Notice how the Page object contains different keys provided by the framework: `onReady`, `onShow` etc. We call them [lifestyle functions](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/en/dev/framework/app-service/page.html).

### Bonus action:

Transform your `<navigator>` from the landing page into a `<button>` element, calling this function on **bindtap**:

```js
//landing.js
goToStoriesPage: function() {
  wx.navigateTo({
    url: '/pages/stories/stories'
  })
}
```
