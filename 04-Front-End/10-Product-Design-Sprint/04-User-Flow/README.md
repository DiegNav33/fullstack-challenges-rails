## User flow (15mn)

Let's take a few minutes to draw your Core User Journey on a piece of paper to make it more understandable.

The goal here is to represent each screen of your Core User Journey, and the links between those screens, in order to create a **User Flow**. To do this quickly, you can take back the 4th sheet of your User Research spreadsheet, and refer to the last column.

The User Flow should give you important indications about the interface you want to build. Basically, it should give you:

- all the screens you will need to sketch and what will be displayed on them
- each link between those screens with the user action (it will help you have the right wording for your product call to action)

Here is an example of Deliveroo's User Flow to order a meal:

> **Keep it simple**
> <br>Here you don't need to use an online tool. Just grab a piece of paper to create your user flow. When it's done you can take a picture of it and share it on slack with your teammates.

The user flow needs to be done seriously. It will help you dispatch the work on your product wireframe. Make sure you validate this step with a teacher before starting the next challenge.
