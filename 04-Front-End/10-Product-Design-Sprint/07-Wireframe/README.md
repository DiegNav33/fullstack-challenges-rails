## Wireframe (1h)

It's time to take back your user flow and to create your wireframe with the help of your UI kit. The goal here is to create a lo-fi mock-up for each screen of your product.

Start by creating a new page on Figma and add a new frame on it. You can draw a rectangle on your new frame and center it in order to put margins on both sides (check 'Rulers' in the Figma/View menu):

> You can remove the rectangle when the margins are well placed

When your first screen is created, you can simply duplicate it by doing a copy/paste. This way, each screen will keep the same margins. Create as many screens on your Figma as you have screens in your user flow.

> **Be careful here** : it's very important that you **create a Figma's frame for each screen** of your app. If you're not sure of your setup, please call a teacher to validate it.

When all the screens are created, each member of your team can take care of one screen (you can also work by groups of 2).

### Use Figma's Grid feature

At some point you'll maybe need to create a grid depending of your project.

If so, Figma's **Grid feature** can help you. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Start by putting all the cards you need on your screen without taking alignment into account.
1. When it's done, select all the cards and click on the blue icon which will appear on the right bottom of your selection.
1. Let Figma's magic happen! It will automatically align all the items you have selected and it will let you adapt the size, the alignment and the space between the items.

Here is a example of the use of Figma's Grid feature:
