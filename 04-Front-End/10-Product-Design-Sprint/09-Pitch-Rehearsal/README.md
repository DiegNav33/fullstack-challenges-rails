## Pitch Rehearsal (30mn)

Time to prepare your pitch! In a few minutes you will present the prototype of your product in front of the class. Here is some advice for your presentation:

- **Take the role of a user**: this is the most efficient way to present your product. Start by exposing your problem as a user and explain how the app can help to resolve it.
- **Keep it short**: 4 minutes should be enough to present your Core User Journey. 
- **Avoid technical vocabulary**: we want to focus on the user experience, so you should avoid using technical vocabulary and speaking about future features.
- **Repeat again and again**: the more you repeat, the more comfortable you will be and the clearer your presentation will be. 

And more importantly: **Be proud of yourself**. Remember your starting idea and see the work you did to finally achieve your prototype.

Good luck!
