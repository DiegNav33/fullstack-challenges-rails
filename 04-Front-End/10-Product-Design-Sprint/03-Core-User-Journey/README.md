## Core User Journey (30mn)

Now that you have a clear product pitch and that you share the same vision, it's time to define your product's **Core User Journey**.

The core user journey is **the main task** a user will do on your app to achieve his/her goal. This is the most important task on your app, and this is the one you will present in front of the class.


### What is a Core User Journey

A user journey represents **all the steps** a user will do to complete a task.

In modern web applications, several tasks can be done by users, through different journeys. Some of these tasks are common to all products (signing up, signing in, editing your profile, etc.) and others are specific. The **common ones should not be included in your prototype** as they don't add any value to your product.

Here you need to focus on the specific tasks of your product and choose the journey which directly answers to the **need you want to fulfill**.

Keep in mind that building a user journey is part of what product designers call **User Research**. We don't want to focus on the product interface here, but more on **each action the user will perform** to achieve his/her goal. Your work here is to describe precisely each step of your core user journey by following these rules:

- Each step should describe a **user action**
- **Keep steps short:** If you can't express a step shortly it is maybe because you need to divide it into 2 steps.
- **Action should be concrete**: avoid vague action descriptions like `The user searches a restaurant` (how does he/she search? By name, by adress, by rate, etc?)
- **Use human words:** we are not focusing on the interface, so avoid words that are used to describe an interface (prefer instead words that describe a user action)

### Your turn!

Take back the spreadsheet you duplicated in the previous challenge and complete the **sheet number 4** with all the steps of your Core User Journey.

The final result should look like a little **scenario of 10 to 15 steps**. When it's done, you can take 5 minutes to precise for each steps if it corresponds to a screen or to a link between two screens.

When it's done, please call a teacher to validate your core user journey.
