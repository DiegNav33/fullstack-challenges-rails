## Basic UI Kit (30mn)

Congratulations! Now that the user research on your product is done, you are going to start working on the prototype of your application.

But before that, you need to take few minutes to build your **UI Kit**.

A UI Kit is a set of lo-fi components, reusable across pages. It will help you implement each screen of your wireframe, and it will help you stay consistent in all screens.

To create the UI Kit and your prototype we'll use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). Sign up and create your project (you can work directly in your browser or [download the desktop app](https://www.figma.com/downloads/)).

> You are going to work on Figma as a team. Only one of you should create the figma project and then invite the rest of the team as collaborators.<br>You can follow the steps described [on this Notion page](https://www.notion.so/Give-edit-access-to-a-Figma-file-e6a2a3d9dce342a7b824e0f71cde9035) to create your collaborative project.

### Create the UI Kit

To build your UI Kit, add a new page called UI Kit and then create a frame to have an idea of the device screen size (it will help you create components that aren't too big or too small).

> We advise you to work together for the UI Kit creation. It will be easier to split the work between teammates when the UI Kit is created.

### Create a grayscale palette

As you will build a lo-fi UI Kit, you'll not use colors to create your components.

But at some point it could be handy to have access to a **grayscale palette** to add some contrast in your components.

Create 5 squares in your UI Kit to implement it. Each one of these squares should have the following background color:

- `#000000` (black)
- `#888888` (dark grey)
- `#BBBBBB` (grey)
- `#DDDDDD` (light grey)
- `#FFFFFF` (white)

This will be the unique color allowed for your lo-fi components.

When all the squares are done, select each square and save each one color as your project colors. It will allow you to access your personal color palette everywhere in your project.

### Create your first component

Now it's time to create your first component. Let's begin with an easy one, **the main title**.

Select the text tool, and create a title with a size of `48px` in `bold`. When it's done, don't forget to click on the **create component** button at the top of your workspace. **It's really important to do that** If you forget about it you will not find this component in the assets tab during the wireframe creation.

Here is an example of what you have to do:

### Create all the basic components

Now that you have created your first component, let's complete your UI Kit.

Here is the list of components you should have in your UI Kit before moving to the next challenge.

- A main title (you already did this one)
- A secondary title
- A paragraph
- A link
- A button
- An input

The last 3 components are more complex. You will need to group several items together. To do that, start by selecting each item, then right-click on the selected items and choose `Group selection` (you can also press `cmd` or `ctrl` + `g`).

Here is an example for the button creation:
