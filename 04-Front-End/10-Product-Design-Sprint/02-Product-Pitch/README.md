## Product pitch (30mn)

A few days ago, a member of your team pitched an idea which has been selected to be developed. This first pitch is the starting point of your product development journey but now we need to turn it into a **Product Pitch**.

The main goal of doing a product pitch is to sharpen your project idea, to define a specific scope and to share a clear vision of what you are going to build.

In order to do that you'll need to define:
- The **need** you want to fulfill (the problem you want to resolve)
- Your user **target** (or segment)
- The **goal** your target wants to achieve by choosing your product
- Your **differentiator(s)** (what makes your product unique)
- And last but not least, you need to choose a **name** for your product

In order to work on this as a team, please make a copy of our [UX Research spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16X7VHSkVXHpedbh3m9Pt0e1psZoxtKNDcoUPpJ16hIs/edit?usp=sharing) and complete **the sheet number 3**.

This is a really important step and it needs to be done seriously to define your Core User Journey. That's why you'll need to **validate your product pitch with a teacher** before starting the next challenge.
