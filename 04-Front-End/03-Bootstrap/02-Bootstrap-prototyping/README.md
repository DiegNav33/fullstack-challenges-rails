## Background & Objectives

Practice using Bootstrap classes. Prototype the [restaurant page](http://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-challenges/02-Bootstrap-prototyping) of Deliveroo using only Bootstrap! (You're not allowed to write any CSS.)

## Specs

For this exercise, the HTML with the Bootstrap grid is already coded for you in the `index.html`.
All you have to do is add the right Bootstrap classes to have the wanted behavior. For example:

```html
<a href="#" class="">I'm a link!</a>
```

To make this link a button you just have to add the classes `btn btn-primary`:

```html
<a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">I'm a button now!</a>
```

You should **not use any CSS** for this exercise, only the Bootstrap classes! That is why we do not give you a `css` folder ðŸ˜‰.

## Further suggestions & resources

- Make sure to use the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1), they have a lot more to offer than `btn` classes!
- Have a look at the [final result](http://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-challenges/02-Bootstrap-prototyping) to compare it with your work.
