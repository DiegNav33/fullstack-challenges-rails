Congratulations for reaching the optional challenges! Today you can choose between two paths: 
- if you want to keep building complex interfaces, stay on this **Slack Copycat** challenge;
- if you'd rather learn about Web **Accessibility**, you can jump to the next challenge.

## Background & Objectives

Build a [copycat of Slack](https://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-challenges/12-Slack/) using the techniques you have learned in this morning's lecture, and previous lectures.

For this challenge you can use both your own css and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), as in the `head` we have both:

```html
 <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
```

For this challenge the components you need are:

- `sidebars.css`
- `badges.css`
- `channels.css`
- `messages.css` (for the individual `.message` design )
- `chat.css` (the white section where the `.message` will be placed + the `input` to write a message.)

And you will have one `layout`:

- `slack.css` (for the general layout structure of the page).

⚠️ **You are designing a static Slack page, no need to be able to switch conversation on the sidebar or actually post a message!**
