## Intro

1. Before the lecture, **clone our [demo boilerplate](https://github.com/lewagon/parsing-demo)**
1. First part of the course describes data files (CSV / XML / JSON).
1. Second part shows how to read/write from CSV and JSON
1. Last part shows how to get data from the web **using an API** or **scraping a website**

## Data formats

1. There are 3 common data formats: CSV, XML & JSON
1. Describe each format using the slides + showing the files in the boilerplate.
1. Explain well, but **don't spend too much time on that**. Lots of live-code coming ðŸ˜Š
1. Explain that all format are heavily used in web services

## Parsing & Storing

1. What's parsing? What's storing?
1. **Live-code** parsing & storing on `data/beatles.csv`
1. **Live-code** parsing & storing on `data/beatles.json`
1. Skip the XML live-code (just show the code in the slides to the students)

## Data from the Web

1. How can we get data from the web? well, **2 options**
1. Using **JSON API**: make a demo using **Chuck Norris API** (like in the slides) or another one of your choice.
1. **Scraping the HTML**: make a demo using **Epicurious** (like in the slides) or another website with a decent markup.

## Flashcards

To help the students master the keys objectives of this reboot day you can encourage them to redo the following deck of flashcards: **Hash & Symbols**.
