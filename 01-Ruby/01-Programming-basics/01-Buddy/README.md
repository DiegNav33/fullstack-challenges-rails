## Background & Objectives
Let's start with a simple challenge to start the day :)

## Specs

### Return your buddy's name

Open the `lib/buddy.rb`. Make sure that the method `today_my_buddys_github_nickname_is` does **`return`** the GitHub username of your buddy. It is different than displaying it (**`puts`**). It should return a `String`! If you don't have a buddy today, just return your own GitHub username.
