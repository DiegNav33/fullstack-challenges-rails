## Background and Objectives

A more advanced challenge now, where you will have to use notions that we haven't covered yet (conditional and looping structures). Don't panic, **we'll see these concepts tomorrow**. Try to go step-by-step and ask yourself what you are trying to accomplish in your program before writing some code.

In this exercise, we will create your own personal coach.
Unfortunately though, the coach is a little stupid and can only exhibit the following behavior:

1. If you don't **ask** her/him something, but just **tell** her/him something (e.g. `"I met a girl last night"`), she/he will just answer back `"I don't care, get dressed and go to work!"`
2. If you ask her/him something (e.g. `"Can I eat some pizza?"`), she/he won't be of much help either and she/he will tell you `"Silly question, get dressed and go to work!"`
3. The **only** way to get rid of her/him is to tell her/him what she/he wants to hear: `"I am going to work right now!"`.

Let's make a comparison between the **real world** and the **code world** on this exercise.

The objectives of this challenge are:
- Understand the **execution flow** of a program and learn how to "read" through your code, line by line
- Learn about **conditional** statements
- Learn about coding structures that modify your program flow: `if/unless..else..end`, `while/until..end`, etc. They are [control structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow)

## Specs

### Coach answer

‚ö†Ô∏è Before you start, please make sure to run `rake` and carefully read the requirements. It will give you a clear overview of what the expected output for both methods is.

In the `lib/coach_answer.rb` file, you will find method definition of `coach_answer`. You can see that it takes one argument, `your_message` which is the sentence you tell the coach. The method should return a `String` (i.e., the coach's answer) which will obviously depend on which value is passed in `your_message`.

Now let's implement an enhanced version of the coach, with the method `coach_answer_enhanced`. If you **SHOUT** at your coach, she/he will like it, and will say: "I can feel your motivation!" before the regular answer. Remember that shouting on the Internet is done by writing in CAPS LOCK! However, if you shout "I AM GOING TO WORK RIGHT NOW!", your coach will leave you alone.

### Interactive Program

- Write the code for the interface that lets you talk to your coach via the terminal.
- **constraint**: This program should **"loop"**. Your coach should answer your message and wait for your next one until you decide to get rid of him. Use a `while..end` or `until..end` structure for that purpose.

If you're getting stuck in an **infinite loop**, just hit `Ctrl` + `C`! It will kill the process.

‚ö†Ô∏è For this exercise you're not finished when `rake` is 100% green! You need to make sure that you can actually ask questions to your coach by running `ruby lib/interface.rb` üòâ

## Key learning points

- What's the usual flow of a program?
- How do structures like `if..else..end` or `while..end` change this flow?
- How do these structures work?
- What's a conditional statement? Which values can it take? What's the difference between `=` and `==`?
- Does a simple method call change the flow of your program?
