## Background and Objectives

- Validate once more your understanding of methods and variables.
- Learn how to use string interpolation.
- Understand the difference between **single** and **double** quotes.

## Specs

### Compute name

- Implement the `compute_name` method defined in the `lib/compute_name.rb` file. Given the `first_name`, `middle_name` and `last_name`, it should return the full name of the person.
- **constraint**: You must use **string interpolation** with `#{}` to build this full name.

### Interactive Program

The `lib/interface.rb` file contains a program to interact with a user. Try it now with:

```bash
ruby lib/interface.rb
```

Your program should then ask you to type your first, middle, and last name into  the terminal.

Then, assuming you have entered "Boris" then "Alexandre" and finally "Papillard", the program should print a custom message like `Hello, Boris Alexandre Papillard!`.

- **constraint**: of course, your `interface.rb` program should use the `compute_name` method defined in the other file.
- **enhancement**: you can improve your `custom_message` by adding other information like the number of characters in your full name (for instance, `Boris Alexandre Papillard has got 25 characters, including spaces`), or other very important details...

## Key learning points

Again, ask yourself these questions and make sure you can answer all of them:

### On variables

- What are the variables in your code?
- Where do you assign values to these variables and where do you use them?
- What's the scope of a variable?

### On methods

- What is the method of your program? Where do you define it?
- Where do you call this method and with which arguments?
- What's the flow of your program when you try to read it line by line?

### On strings

- What's string interpolation? What's the syntax to "insert" some Ruby expression in a string?
- What's the difference between single-quotes `''` or double-quotes `""` when using string interpolation?

## Further suggestions & resources

- To get a user input or answer from the terminal you should use [gets](http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/Tutorial/part_02/user_input.html). You will also need to [chomp](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.1.2/String.html#method-i-chomp) the resulting string
- To print a question in the terminal, you should use [puts](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.1.2/IO.html#method-i-puts)
