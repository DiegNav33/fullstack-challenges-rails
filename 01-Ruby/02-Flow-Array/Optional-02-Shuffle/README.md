## Background & Objectives

An advanced exercise that makes you write a `shuffle` method that takes an array and returns a totally shuffled version. But how would you make sure you are getting an actual shuffle? What would you even say a good shuffle would be?

## Specs

### Core

- In `lib/shuffle.rb`, write the `#shuffle` method.
- You should use the Ruby `rand()` method
- To write your algorithm, you are not authorized to use any fancy Array methods like `sort_by` or `shuffle`!

**Hint**: You should not change the original Array. You might need to [`clone`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-3.1.2/Object.html#method-i-clone) the array into an array A to manipulate the copy. One algorithm could be to create a new empty array B, and until A is empty, randomly select an index in A, append the element in A at that index in B, then deleting that index in A. Proceed until A is empty. B should contain the new shuffled array!
