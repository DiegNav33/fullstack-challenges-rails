## Background & Objectives

Only one lesson to learn from this exercise: **READ THE ERROR**! The message will tell you:
- what kind of error you have
- the line in your program where it occurs

## Specs

Just run

```bash
rake
```

the code in `bugged_concatenate.rb` has a few errors. Try to fix them by reading the messages in the terminal.
