## Background & Objectives

Practice using `if/else` to modify the flow of your code.

Hint:

```ruby
if condition
  # execute if condition is truthy
else
  # execute if condition is falsy
end
```

## Specs

- Write a method in Ruby that returns `true` if the age entered is old enough to vote, and `false` if not (people 18 years old and older can vote).

## Key learning points

- What is the syntax when using an `if/else` statement?

## Optional

- Can you think of a way to refactor your code using one line only?
