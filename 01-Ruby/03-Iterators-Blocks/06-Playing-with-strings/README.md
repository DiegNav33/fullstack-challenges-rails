## Objective

Write a method that determines whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome, that is, it reads the same backwards as forwards, ignoring case, spaces and punctuation.

## Further suggestions

Methods you might find useful (which you'll have to look up in Ruby documentation, ruby-doc.org) include: `String#downcase, String#gsub, String#reverse`

## Enhance/Refactor

Once you have your code working, try and make it prettier by using techniques like method chaining.
