The Ruby module has 6 blocks. The first 4 blocks deal with core notions you absolutely need to understand.

### `01 Programming Basics`

Play with IRB and launch a Ruby script from the terminal. Learn about variables, methods and built-in classes.

### `02 Flow, Conditionals & Arrays`

Learn about conditional statements and loops, coding structures that modify the flow of your programs. Discover and play with arrays.

### `03 Iterators & Blocks`

Embrace all the cool Ruby iterators (`each`, `select`, `map` and more). Understand what a Ruby block is and how a method can call a block with `yield`.

### `04 Hash & Symbols`

Discover and play with hashes, data structures designed to store key-value pairs like dictionaries. Understand symbols, objects a bit similar to strings but more adapted for storing identifiers. Symbols are very often used as hash keys.

#### Ruby quiz

During this fourth block, there is a short quiz on the Ruby module. It was designed to help you assess what you have learnt so far. There is neither grade nor ranking, it's just for you ðŸ˜Š The teacher will correct the quiz in front of the class, at the end of the session.

## Advanced part

The two last blocks of the Ruby module deal with more advanced notions. These notions are not essential. All students should attend the lecture but, for the challenges, the class is split between:
- A "Reboot" group who will rehearse core notions (variables, methods, arrays, hashes and iterators) practicing on new challenges.
- The rest of the class will practice these advanced notions on dedicated challenges.

If you don't feel confident about the core notions, join the Reboot group! It's an opportunity to strengthen what really matters for the rest of the bootcamp.

### `05 Regular Expressions`

Play with regular expressions, a.k.a regex, which represents string patterns.

### `06 Parsing`

Learn to read and write in standard data files such as CSV and JSON, and interact with your first API.
